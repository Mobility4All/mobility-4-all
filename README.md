## Mobility-4-All

Mobility 4 All (MO) is a mobile web application ride service built to meet the needs of people with disabilities and other special needs. A rider can share accessibility needs with their driver and drivers are trained to provide a high touch service that creates comfort, trust, and a true door-to-door service. It is intended to serve those that are normally served by Metro Mobility services while using an on demand Uber or Lyft-like model, tailored to the individual user. This new service will also link to other transport options to assist MO users with their various transport needs around the Twin Cities.

## Steps to get the development environment running.

-- Create database first with below command (this version used Postico as a database manager)

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE "mobility_4_all";
```

-- Install PostGIS to make db friendlier for geolocation (if Homebrew is install)

```git
brew install postgis
```

--(for reference PostGIS download http://postgis.net/install/)
--then run this in Postico--

```SQL
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

-- Navigate into database and use the below data to create tables

```SQL
